# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0 (March 23, 2025)

### Initial Release

We're excited to announce the first stable release of the Opera Omnia MCP Server! This release provides a complete implementation of an MCP server that gives access to all the features of the Opera Omnia project.

### Features

- **Complete Dataset Access**: Access to all Opera Omnia datasets including attributes, characters, equipment, RPG elements, situations, story elements, and world-building components.

- **Powerful Tools**:
  - `list_categories`: List all available data categories
  - `list_datasets`: List all datasets within a category
  - `get_dataset`: Get the complete contents of a specific dataset
  - `get_random_item`: Get a random item from a specific dataset
  - `get_filtered_items`: Get items from a dataset that match specific criteria
  - `combine_datasets`: Combine multiple datasets and get random selections
  - `generate_content`: Generate creative content based on multiple datasets

- **Resource Browsing**: Browse available datasets through MCP resources:
  - `opera-omnia://categories`: List of all categories
  - `opera-omnia://category/{category}`: List of datasets in a category
  - `opera-omnia://dataset/{category}/{dataset}`: Contents of a specific dataset

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation on how to use the server, available datasets, and integration with Claude.

- **Example Scripts**: Multiple example scripts demonstrating how to use the MCP server for various use cases.

### Technical Details

- Built with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Efficient data fetching from the GitHub repository with caching
- Simplified MCP SDK implementation for easier maintenance
- Comprehensive error handling

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. Add the server to your MCP settings file (see documentation)

### Known Issues

- The server currently fetches data directly from GitHub. In future versions, we plan to add support for local data files.
- The content generation capabilities are currently limited to simple template substitution. More sophisticated generation methods are planned for future releases.

### Future Plans

- Add more sophisticated content generation capabilities
- Implement better caching for improved performance
- Add support for user-contributed datasets
- Create visualization tools for exploring the data
